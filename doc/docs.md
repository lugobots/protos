The kick speed will suffer a power reduction proportionally to the player direction when the kick is not in the
same direction of the player direction. The reduction is calculated based on the angle with the player direction
using the formula `SpeedReducerFactor = 0.5 &#43; (0.5 * ((180 - ang) / 180))`
In summary, the speed will by reduced proportionally to the angle from 100% at 0 degrees until the limit of
50% at 180 degrees.

the limit.

| GET_READY | 1 | The game resets the players position to start the match or to restart the match after a goal. |
| LISTENING | 2 | The game is waiting for players orders. There is a configurable time window for this phase. After the time limit expires, the server will ignore the missing orders and process the ones it got. (when running on dev mode, the server may allow different behaviours) |
| PLAYING | 3 | The game is executing the players&#39; orders in the same sequence they were gotten. If the ball is NOT been holden, its velocity will be processed first. Otherwise, it position will be updated when the ball holder movement be processed. If there is no movement orders from a player, but it has speed greater than 0, it will be processed after all its orders are processed. Each player orders will be processed in the same sequence they were included in the message (e.g. first move, than kick) The ball kick is processed immediately after the order (the ball position is updated as its new velocity after the kick) |
| SHIFTING | 4 | The game interrupt the match to shift the ball possession. It happens only when the shot time is over (see shot_clock property). The ball will be given to the goalkeeper of the defense team, and the next state will &#34;listening&#34;, so the bots will not have time to rearrange before the next turn. |
| OVER | 99 | The game may be over after any phase. It can be over after Waiting if there is no players connected after the time limit for connections It can be over after GetReady or Listening if there is no enough players (e.g. connection lost) And it also can be over after Playing state if that was the last turn of the match. |
